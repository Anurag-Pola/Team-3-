    An edublog is a blog created for educational purposes. Edublogs archive and support student and teacher learning by
     facilitating reflection, questioning by self and others, collaboration[1] and by providing contexts for engaging in
      higher-order thinking.[2][3] Edublogs proliferated when blogging architecture became more simplified and teachers
       perceived the instructional potential of blogs as an online resource.[1] The use of blogs has become popular in
        education institutions including public schools and colleges.[4] Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information
    and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples
     include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained for the purpose of classroom instruction,
     or blogs written about educational policy. Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers.
